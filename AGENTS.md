# AI Agent Development Context

This document provides essential context for AI assistants working on the Anode
project.

Current work state and next steps. What works, what doesn't. Last updated:
January 2025.

**Development Workflow**: The user will typically be running the wrangler server
and web client in separate tabs. If you need to check work, run a build and/or
lints, tests, typechecks. If the user isn't running the dev environment, tell
them how to start it at the base of the repo with pnpm.

## Project Overview

Anode is a real-time collaborative notebook system built on LiveStore, an
event-sourcing based local-first data synchronization library.

**Current Status**: Production-ready collaborative notebook system. Real-time collaboration, Python execution with rich outputs, and AI integration all working. Uses unified output system with granular, type-safe events.

## Architecture

- **Schema** (`jsr:@runt/schema`): LiveStore schema definitions (events, state,
  materializers) - Published JSR package imported by all packages with full type
  inference. Comes via https://github.com/runtimed/runt's deno monorepo
- **Web Client** (`@anode/web-client`): React-based web interface
- **Document Worker** (`@anode/docworker`): Cloudflare Worker for sync backend
- **Pyodide Runtime Agent** (`@anode/pyodide-runtime-agent`): Python execution
  client

## Key Dependencies

- **LiveStore**: Event-sourcing library for local-first apps
- **Effect**: Functional programming library for TypeScript
- **React**: UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Primary language

## Current Working State

### What's Actually Working ✅

- ✅ **LiveStore integration** - Event-sourcing with real-time collaboration
- ✅ **Python execution** - Code cells run Python via Pyodide with rich outputs
  (matplotlib SVG, pandas HTML, IPython.display)
- ✅ **Real-time collaboration** - Multiple users can edit notebooks
  simultaneously
- ✅ **Cell management** - Create, edit, move, delete cells with proper state
  sync
- ✅ **Rich output rendering** - Full IPython display support: matplotlib SVG,
  pandas HTML, colored terminal output
- ✅ **AI integration** - Full notebook context awareness, sees previous cells
  and their outputs
- ✅ **AI tool calling** - AI can create new cells and modify them using
  function calling
- ✅ **Context inclusion controls** - Users can exclude cells from AI context
  with visibility toggles
- ✅ **Production deployment** - Web client and sync backend deployed to
  Cloudflare (Pages + Workers)
- ✅ **Authentication** - Google OAuth and fallback token system working in
  production
- ✅ **Mobile support** - Responsive design with mobile keyboard optimizations
- ✅ **Offline-first operation** - Works without network, syncs when connected
- ✅ **Package caching** - Pre-loading scientific stack (numpy, pandas,
  matplotlib) for faster startup
- ✅ **AI context with outputs** - AI sees execution results, not just source
  code, for intelligent assistance with data analysis
- ✅ **Unified Output System** - Granular, type-safe events for all output types
- ✅ **Clear output functionality** - `clear_output(wait=True/False)` working properly
- ✅ **Terminal output grouping** - Consecutive terminal outputs merge naturally
- ✅ **Error output rendering** - Proper traceback display with JSON error parsing
- ✅ **All tests passing** - 58/58 tests covering output system

### Core Architecture Constraints

- `NOTEBOOK_ID = STORE_ID`: Each notebook gets its own LiveStore database
- **Event-sourced state**: All changes flow through LiveStore events
- **Reactive execution**: `executionRequested` → `executionAssigned` →
  `executionStarted` → `executionCompleted` events, materialized table is an
  execution queue
- **Direct TypeScript schema**: No build step, imports work across packages
- **Session-based runtimes**: Each runtime restart gets unique `sessionId`
- **One kernel per notebook**: Each notebook has exactly one active kernel at a
  time

### Kernel-Notebook Relationship

**One Kernel Per Notebook**: Each notebook should have exactly one active kernel
at any time. Multiple kernels on the same notebook should only occur during
transition periods (kernel restart/handoff).

**Kernel Lifecycle**:

- Notebook created → No kernel (user must start one)
- User starts kernel → Becomes the sole kernel for that notebook
- Kernel crashes/stops → Notebook has no kernel until user starts new one
- Kernel restart → Brief overlap during handoff, then old kernel terminates

**Not Yet Implemented**: Automatic kernel orchestration, graceful handoffs,
kernel health monitoring. Currently manual kernel startup creates potential for
multiple kernels during transitions.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Setup
pnpm install  # Automatically creates package .env files with defaults

# In separate tabs run
## Tab 1:
pnpm dev
## Tab 2:
pnpm dev:sync

# Start runtime (get command from notebook UI)
# Runtime command is now dynamic via VITE_RUNTIME_COMMAND environment variable
# Get runtime command from notebook UI, then:
NOTEBOOK_ID=notebook-id-from-ui pnpm dev:runtime
```

## Current Priorities

**Current Focus**: Enhanced user experience and future features

### Potential Next Development Phase

1. **Artifact Service** - For large output content (see docs/proposals/artifacts-service.md)
   - File upload and download capabilities
   - Large media content external storage
   - Bandwidth optimization for large outputs
2. **Enhanced AI Capabilities** - Building on solid foundation
   - Streaming AI responses with append operations
   - Better context management with new output structure
3. **Kernel Management Improvements** - Production runtime features
   - Automated kernel orchestration
   - Better session management
   - Health monitoring

**Foundation Complete**: Core output system provides type safety, performance, and streaming capabilities

## Important Considerations

### Schema Design

- **JSR schema package**: `jsr:@runt/schema` provides zero-build-step imports
  with type inference across all packages

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Materializer Determinism Requirements

LiveStore requires all materializers to be **pure functions without side
effects**. Avoid non-deterministic operations (like `Date()` calls) that could
produce different results across clients. Using `ctx.query()` for deterministic
data access is fine.

**What caused the bug:**

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - This causes LiveStore.UnexpectedError materializer hash mismatch
"v1.ExecutionCompleted": ({ queueId }, ctx) => {
  const queueEntries = ctx.query(
    tables.executionQueue.select().where({ id: queueId }).limit(1)
  );
  // ... rest of materializer
}
```

**Correct approach:**

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - All needed data in event payload
"v1.ExecutionCompleted": ({ queueId, cellId, status }) => [
  tables.executionQueue.update({
    status: status === "success" ? "completed" : "failed"
  }).where({ id: queueId }),
  tables.cells.update({
    executionState: status === "success" ? "completed" : "error"
  }).where({ id: cellId }),
]
```

**Fixed commits for reference:**

- `6e0fb4f`: Fixed ExecutionCompleted/ExecutionCancelled materializers
- `a1bf20d`: Fixed ExecutionStarted materializer

**Rule**: Materializers must be deterministic and reproducible. Avoid
non-deterministic operations, but using `ctx.query()` for deterministic data
lookups is acceptable.

### Local-First Architecture

- All data operations happen locally first
- Events synced across clients via document worker
- SQLite provides local reactive state per notebook
- Network connectivity optional, but is essential for runtime access

### Code Style

- Prefer functional programming patterns (Effect library)
- Event sourcing over direct state mutations
- Reactive queries over imperative data fetching
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Granular, type-safe events with clear schemas
- Prefer specific event types over complex discriminated unions

- Say "this is a prototype" or "this part needs work" when true
- Always bring a towel

## Development Workflow Notes

- **User Environment**: The user will typically have:
  - Web client running in one tab (`pnpm dev`)
  - Wrangler server running in another tab (`pnpm dev:sync`)
  - Python runtime available via `pnpm dev:runtime` (uses @runt JSR packages,
    command customizable via VITE_RUNTIME_COMMAND)

**Checking Work**: If you need to verify changes:

```bash
# Build and check for issues
pnpm build           # Build all packages (now with unified output system)
pnpm lint            # Check code style
pnpm test            # Run test suite (58/58 passing)
pnpm type-check      # TypeScript validation (full type safety)
```

**If User Isn't Running Dev Environment**: Tell them to start at the base of the
repo:

```bash
# Setup environment
pnpm install         # Install dependencies (includes linked @runt/schema)
cp .env.example .env # Copy environment template

# In separate tabs run
## Tab 1:
pnpm dev             # Web client (with new output rendering)
## Tab 2:
pnpm dev:sync        # Sync worker (handles new events)

# Python runtime (get NOTEBOOK_ID from UI, then run):
# Runtime command is customizable via VITE_RUNTIME_COMMAND in .env
NOTEBOOK_ID=your-notebook-id pnpm dev:runtime
```

## Communication Guidelines for AI Assistants

### Senior Engineering Collaboration

- **Write for staff/principal engineers**: Assume deep technical knowledge
- **Be concise and precise**: Remove redundant explanations
- **Lead with facts**: State what is, not what could be
- **Show working code**: Demonstrate solutions with actual implementations
- **Identify root causes**: Address underlying issues, not symptoms
- **Use technical terminology correctly**: Precision matters in technical
  communication

### Code Review Standards

- **Reference specific lines/functions**: Use exact file paths and line numbers
- **Explain the "why"**: Technical rationale behind changes
- **Highlight trade-offs**: Acknowledge design decisions and their implications
- **Suggest concrete improvements**: Actionable recommendations with code
  examples
- **Maintain consistency**: Follow existing patterns and conventions

### Problem-Solving Approach

- **Start with diagnosis**: Understand the system state before proposing
  solutions
- **Use systematic debugging**: Add logging, isolate components, test hypotheses
- **Verify assumptions**: Check actual behavior against expected behavior
- **Consider edge cases**: Think through failure modes and boundary conditions
- **Document findings**: Leave clear breadcrumbs for future developers

### Technical Communication

- **Use standard terminology**: Stick to established technical vocabulary
- **Be specific with versions**: Reference exact package versions, commit hashes
- **Include reproduction steps**: Clear instructions for recreating issues
- **Separate concerns**: Distinguish between bugs, features, and technical debt
- **Quantify impact**: Use metrics and benchmarks where relevant
