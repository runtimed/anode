# Anode Development Roadmap

**Vision**: A real-time collaborative notebook system enabling seamless AI ↔
Python ↔ User interactions through local-first architecture.

## Foundation Complete ✅

### Core Architecture

- **LiveStore event-sourcing** - Real-time collaborative state management
- **Cell management** - Create, edit, move, delete with proper state sync
- **"Python" execution** - Rich outputs: matplotlib SVG, pandas HTML,
  IPython.display
- **Pseudo-Production deployment** - Cloudflare Pages + Workers with Google
  OAuth authentication

### What Users Can Do Today

- Create and edit notebooks collaboratively in real-time at
  https://anode.pages.dev
- Execute Python code with rich outputs (matplotlib SVG plots, pandas HTML
  tables, colored terminal)
- Use AI cells with full notebook context awareness (sees previous cells and
  their outputs)
- Control what context AI sees with visibility toggles
- Have AI create new cells using OpenAI function calling
- Navigate cells with keyboard shortcuts and mobile-optimized interface
- Work offline and sync when connected through local-first architecture
- Package caching for faster Python startup (numpy, pandas, matplotlib
  pre-loaded)

## Immediate Priorities (Next 2-3 Weeks)

### 1. Enhanced AI Tool Calling

**Goal**: Expand AI capabilities beyond just creating cells

**Current State**: AI can only create cells via `create_cell` function
**Target**: AI can modify existing cells and execute code

**Implementation Tasks**:

- [x] **Function calling infrastructure** - OpenAI function calling working
- [x] **Cell creation tools** - AI can create new cells with `create_cell` tool
- [x] **Cell modification tools** - Add `modify_cell(cellId, content)` function
      to NOTEBOOK_TOOLS
- [x] **Code execution tools** - Add `execute_cell(cellId)` function to
      NOTEBOOK_TOOLS
- [ ] **Parameter validation** - Add comprehensive JSDoc and parameter
      validation

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- AI can modify existing cell content when requested
- AI can execute cells and see results
- All tool calls work reliably with proper error handling

### 2. User Confirmation Flows

**Goal**: Safe execution of AI-initiated actions

**Current State**: No user confirmation for AI actions **Target**: UI dialogs
for confirming destructive operations

**Implementation Tasks**:

- [ ] **Confirmation dialog UI** - Design and implement confirmation dialog
      component
- [ ] **Risk categorization** - Implement risk-based confirmation (safe vs
      destructive operations)
- [ ] **LiveStore events** - Add confirmation events to schema
- [ ] **Web client integration** - Wire up confirmation flows in web client
- [ ] **Bypass for safe operations** - Allow safe operations to skip
      confirmation

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users can approve/reject AI tool calls before execution
- Clear indication of what the AI wants to do
- Safe operations (create_cell) can bypass confirmation
- Destructive operations (modify_cell, execute_cell) require confirmation

### 3. User-Attributed Runtime Agents ("Bring Your Own Compute")

**Goal**: Enable users to run standalone runtime agents with API tokens

**Current State**: All runtimes use shared authentication **Target**: Users can
attach runtimes with their own API tokens

**Implementation Tasks**:

- [ ] **API token system** - Generate user-specific tokens for runtime
      authentication
- [ ] **Token management UI** - Users can create, view, revoke tokens
- [ ] **Standalone runtime agents** - Runtimes authenticate with user tokens
      instead of shared auth
- [ ] **Runtime attribution** - Show which user's compute is running the runtime
- [ ] **Documentation** - Clear instructions for running user-owned runtime agents

**Benefits**:

- Removes shared authentication dependency
- Enables production scaling with user-owned compute
- Clear attribution of resource usage

### 4. Automated Runtime Management

**Goal**: Remove manual `NOTEBOOK_ID=xyz pnpm dev:runtime` friction

**Technical Challenges**:

- Runtime spawning in browser environment
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Security considerations for runtime execution
- Resource management and cleanup

**Implementation Tasks**:

- [ ] **Runtime orchestration architecture** - Design runtime spawning mechanism
- [ ] **One-click runtime startup** - Create "Start Runtime" button in notebook UI
- [ ] **Auto-spawning Runtime** - One-click notebook startup
- [ ] **Runtime health monitoring** - Detect failures and restart automatically

---

This roadmap reflects the reality that Anode is already a working production
system. The focus is on expansion and enhancement rather than proving basic
functionality works. Core collaborative editing, Python execution with rich
outputs, and AI integration are all validated and deployed.

**Key Insight**: The foundation is solid - LiveStore event-sourcing, reactive
architecture, and comprehensive testing provide a reliable base for building
advanced features.

**Next Update**: This roadmap will be updated monthly based on progress and user
feedback.
