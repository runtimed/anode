# Production Environment Variables for Anode
#
# Copy this file to `.env.production` and fill in your actual production values.
# All of these variables are REQUIRED for production builds.
#
# The build will fail if any of these are not set, preventing accidental
# deployments with development defaults.

# OAuth/OIDC Authentication endpoint
# Example: https://auth.yourdomain.com/oidc
VITE_AUTH_URI="https://your-auth-provider.com/oidc"

# OAuth client ID for this application
# Example: prod-anode-client-id
VITE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID="your-production-client-id"

# OAuth redirect URI - must match your app's production URL
# Example: https://app.yourdomain.com/oidc
VITE_AUTH_REDIRECT_URI="https://your-app-domain.com/oidc"

# WebSocket URL for LiveStore synchronization
# Example: wss://sync.yourdomain.com
VITE_LIVESTORE_SYNC_URL="wss://your-sync-endpoint.com"

# URI for iframe-based outputs (e.g., interactive visualizations)
# Example: https://output.yourdomain.com
VITE_IFRAME_OUTPUT_URI="https://your-output-domain.com"

# Additional production-specific variables (not validated by build)
# These can be added as needed:

# Runtime command (if different from default)
# VITE_RUNTIME_COMMAND="your-production-runtime-command"

# Logging configuration
# RUNT_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
# RUNT_DISABLE_CONSOLE_LOGS=true
