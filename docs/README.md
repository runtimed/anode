# Anode Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the Anode project - a real-time
collaborative notebook system with AI integration.

## Quick Navigation

### 📖 Core Documentation

- **[UI Design](./ui-design.md)** - Design principles and interface guidelines
- **[Testing](./TESTING.md)** - Testing strategy and current gaps
- **[Technologies](./technologies/README.md)** - Introduction to the various technologies used

### 📋 Proposals

- **[AI Context Controls](./proposals/ai-context-controls.md)** - User controls
  for AI context inclusion/exclusion ✅ **Implemented**
- **[Updateable Outputs](./proposals/updateable-outputs.md)** -
  Jupyter-compatible display updates and stream merging

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Anode is a simplified single-application notebook system that provides:

- **Web Client**: React-based notebook interface with real-time collaboration
- **Sync Worker**: Cloudflare Worker handling LiveStore synchronization
- **Python Runtime**: Handled by separate `@runt` packages for execution and AI
  features

**Key Technologies:**

- **LiveStore**: Event-sourcing based local-first data synchronization
- **React**: Modern web interface with real-time collaborative editing
- **Vite**: Build system and development server
- **Cloudflare**: Pages (web client) + Workers (sync backend) deployment

### 🚀 Current Status

### 🔧 For Developers

**Getting Started:**

1. Read [ui-design.md](./ui-design.md) for interface design patterns
2. Check [ai-context-visibility.md](./ai-context-visibility.md) for context
   control features
3. See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for testing approach
4. Review [proposals/](./proposals/) for planned features

**Key Files:**

- `src/components/notebook/` - Notebook interface components
- `src/sync/sync.ts` - Cloudflare Worker for LiveStore sync
- `src/components/ui/` - Reusable UI components
- `schema.ts` - Local LiveStore schema definitions (for web client)
- `@runt/schema` - Primary LiveStore schema (JSR package, used by runtimes)

**Development Commands:**

```bash
# Start development
pnpm dev          # Web client at http://localhost:5173
pnpm dev:sync     # Sync worker at ws://localhost:8787

# Testing & Validation
pnpm test         # Run test suite (36 tests)
pnpm build        # Build web client
pnpm type-check   # TypeScript validation

# Python Runtime (separate setup)
# See https://github.com/runtimed/runt
```

### 🧠 Design Philosophy

Anode's design is guided by these principles:

- **Local-First**: Works offline, syncs when connected.
- **Event-Sourced**: All changes flow through LiveStore events.
- **Collaborative**: Real-time multi-user editing without conflicts.
- **Simple**: Single application, standard project structure.
- **Type-Safe**: End-to-end TypeScript.
- **Modular**: Clean separation between UI and runtime concerns.

### 🤝 Contributing

When contributing to the UI:

1.  **Follow design system**: Use established patterns from `ui-design.md`.
2.  **Test thoroughly**: Add tests for new features (see `TESTING.md`).
3.  **Consider collaboration**: How will features work with multiple users?
4.  **Think mobile-first**: Ensure responsive design.
5.  **Maintain accessibility**: Follow ARIA guidelines.
