# AI Context Controls Architecture Proposal

**Status**: Implemented âœ…\
**Author**: Development Team\
**Date**: June 2025\

## Overview

This document outlines the implemented architecture for giving users granular
control over which notebook cells are included in AI context, enabling better
token management, privacy control, and focused AI interactions.

## Background

Anode now provides full user control over AI context. Users can include/exclude
any cell from AI context using visibility toggles. This solved several
challenges:

- **Token Limits**: Large notebooks may exceed AI model token limits
- **Privacy Concerns**: Users may want to exclude sensitive cells from AI
- **Focused Interactions**: AI responses may be better when limited to relevant
  context
- **Performance**: Reducing context size improves response speed and cost

## Goals

- **User Control**: Simple UI for including/excluding cells from AI context âœ…
  IMPLEMENTED
- **Token Management**: Automatic handling of token limits with user feedback ðŸš§
  PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Privacy**: Secure exclusion of sensitive content from AI requests âœ…
  IMPLEMENTED
- **Performance**: Optimize AI response speed and cost through context control
  âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Collaboration**: Context controls work seamlessly in multi-user environments
  âœ… IMPLEMENTED

## Proposed Architecture

### Cell-Level Context Controls

Each cell gets an inclusion state for AI context:

```typescript
interface CellContextState {
  cellId: string;
  includeInAiContext: boolean;
  contextReason?: string; // "user-excluded", "auto-excluded", "token-limit"
  lastModified: number;
  modifiedBy: string;
}
```

### LiveStore Schema Extensions

```typescript
// New events for context control
cellAiContextChanged: Events.synced({
  name: "v1.CellAiContextChanged",
  schema: Schema.Struct({
    cellId: Schema.String,
    includeInAiContext: Schema.Boolean,
    reason: Schema.optional(Schema.String),
    changedBy: Schema.String,
  }),
}),

// Bulk context operations
cellsAiContextBulkChanged: Events.synced({
  name: "v1.CellsAiContextBulkChanged",
  schema: Schema.Struct({
    cellIds: Schema.Array(Schema.String),
    includeInAiContext: Schema.Boolean,
    reason: Schema.String,
    changedBy: Schema.String,
  }),
}),
```

### UI Implementation

#### Cell-Level Controls

Cell-level context controls will be implemented as:

- Toggle button in cell header (eye icon for visibility)
- Visual indicator of inclusion/exclusion state
- Tooltip feedback for user understanding
- Integration with existing cell UI components

Specific UI implementation and styling to be determined during development.

#### Bulk Operations Toolbar

Notebook-level context controls will provide:

- Bulk operations for selected cells (include/exclude)
- Preset filters (code-only, recent cells, etc.)
- Integration with LiveStore events for persistence
- Clear visual feedback for bulk operations

Specific UI layout and interaction patterns to be designed during
implementation.

### Context Building Logic

Context building logic will handle:

- Filtering cells based on inclusion preferences
- Formatting cells with source code and recent outputs
- Token estimation and limit management
- Auto-exclusion strategies when approaching limits
- Context truncation and user notification

Implementation details for context formatting, token estimation, and limit
handling to be determined during development.

### Smart Context Suggestions

Smart context suggestions will implement:

- Relevance scoring based on keyword matching
- Cell type preferences for different prompt types
- Recency bonuses for recently executed cells
- Configurable relevance thresholds and limits
- Integration with user context preferences

Specific relevance algorithms and scoring mechanisms to be designed during
implementation.

### Token Usage Feedback

Token usage feedback will provide:

- Visual progress indicator showing context usage
- Color-coded status (good/warning/danger)
- Numerical token counts for transparency
- Warning indicators when approaching limits
- Integration with AI cell interface

Specific UI design and warning thresholds to be determined during
implementation.

## Default Behavior

### Initial State

- **All cells included by default** - Maintains current behavior
- **User can opt-out** rather than opt-in for ease of use
- **Smart suggestions** offered when approaching token limits

### Auto-Exclusion Rules

Auto-exclusion rules will be configurable and include:

- Large cell detection and automatic exclusion
- Age-based exclusion for old, less relevant cells
- Marker-based exclusion for user-tagged private content
- Token budget enforcement with smart prioritization

Specific rules, thresholds, and configuration mechanisms to be designed during
implementation.

## Collaborative Behavior

### Multi-User Context

- **Personal context preferences** - Each user can have different inclusion
  settings
- **Shared notebook state** - But context controls are per-user, not global
- **Conflict resolution** - Not needed since context is per-user

### Implementation

User-specific context preferences will be stored separately from global notebook
state, allowing each user to have personalized context settings without
affecting others.

Implementation approach for user preference storage and synchronization to be
determined.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Cell Controls âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] Add context inclusion state to cell schema (aiContextVisible field)
- [x] Implement cell-level toggle UI (eye icon in cell headers)
- [x] Create context building logic (respects visibility preferences)
- [x] Add visual indicators for included/excluded cells

### Phase 2: Bulk Operations ðŸš§ FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

- [ ] Implement notebook-level context controls
- [ ] Add bulk include/exclude operations
- [ ] Create preset filters (code-only, recent, etc.)
- [ ] Handle token limit auto-exclusions

### Phase 3: Smart Suggestions ðŸš§ FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

- [ ] Implement relevance calculation engine
- [ ] Add context suggestion UI
- [ ] Create auto-exclusion rules
- [ ] Performance optimization for large notebooks

### Phase 4: Multi-User Support âœ… IMPLEMENTED

- [x] Implement per-user context preferences (each user controls their own
      context)
- [x] Add user preference persistence (stored in LiveStore)
- [x] Handle collaborative scenarios (works seamlessly with real-time
      collaboration)
- [ ] Add sharing/importing of context settings (future enhancement)

## Open Questions

### User Experience

- **Q**: Should context controls be visible by default or hidden in a menu?
- **Q**: How to handle context controls in read-only notebooks?
- **Q**: Should there be keyboard shortcuts for context operations?

### Token Management

- **Q**: How aggressive should auto-exclusion be when approaching limits?
- **Q**: Should users be warned before auto-exclusion happens?
- **Q**: How to handle different AI models with different token limits?

### Performance

- **Q**: How to efficiently calculate relevance for large notebooks?
- **Q**: Should context building be cached or computed fresh each time?
- **Q**: How to handle real-time context updates as cells change?

### Collaboration

- **Q**: Should there be an option to share context preferences between users?
- **Q**: How to handle notebooks with hundreds of collaborators?
- **Q**: Should admins be able to set default context policies?

## Success Metrics

- **User Adoption**: % of users who modify default context settings
- **Token Efficiency**: Reduction in context tokens while maintaining AI quality
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on AI response relevance
- **Performance**: Context building completes in < 500ms
- **Accuracy**: Smart suggestions match user selections 70%+ of time
