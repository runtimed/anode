# IFrame Outputs

To check that this code works, `cd` into the root of this repo, and then run `pnpm run dev:iframe`. Open the browser to `localhost:8000/react.html`.

This directory now uses Vite for development and building of the iframe content.

See this README for more details (from root dir):
