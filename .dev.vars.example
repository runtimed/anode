# This is an example file for local Worker development.
# Copy this file to .dev.vars and fill in the values.
# This file SHOULD NOT contain real production secrets.

# Development mode: Use a hardcoded token for local development
AUTH_TOKEN="insecure-token-change-me"

# Production mode: Set the AUTH_ISSUER to connect to a real OIDC provider
# AUTH_ISSUER="https://your-oauth-provider.com"

# Note: The auth system supports two modes:
# 1. Development mode: Uses AUTH_TOKEN (hardcoded secret string)
# 2. Production mode: Uses AUTH_ISSUER (OIDC provider URL)
# 
# In production mode, the frontend should be configured with:
# - VITE_AUTH_ISSUER: The OIDC issuer URL
# - VITE_CLIENT_ID: Your OAuth client ID
#
# The backend expects RS256 JWT tokens from the OIDC provider.
