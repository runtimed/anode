# Note: The auth system supports two modes:
# 1. Development mode: Uses AUTH_TOKEN (hardcoded secret string)
# 2. Production mode: Uses AUTH_ISSUER (OIDC provider URL)
# 
# In production mode, the frontend should be configured with:
# - VITE_AUTH_ISSUER: The OIDC issuer URL
# - VITE_CLIENT_ID: Your OAuth client ID
#
# The backend expects RS256 JWT tokens from the OIDC provider.
