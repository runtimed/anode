# Pyodide Autocomplete Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Python Runtime Completion Support ✅

### Core Completion Function
- [x] Add `get_completions()` function to `runt_runtime_shell.py`
- [x] Handle cursor position parsing (line number and position within line)
- [x] Use IPython's `shell.Completer.completions()` 
- [x] Return completion matches with cursor positions
- [x] Add error handling for completion failures

## Phase 2: Worker Message Protocol Extension ✅

### Worker Message Handling
- [x] Add `get_completions` case to message handler in `pyodide-worker.ts`
- [x] Call Python `get_completions()` function from worker
- [x] Handle worker-side errors gracefully
- [x] Return completion results via worker message response

### Testing Worker Protocol
- [ ] Test completion message handling in worker
- [ ] Verify error scenarios (invalid code, cursor position)
- [ ] Test with various Python code samples

## Phase 3: Agent API Extension ✅

### PyodideRuntimeAgent Methods
- [x] Add `getCompletions()` method to `PyodideRuntimeAgent` class
- [x] Use existing `sendWorkerMessage()` infrastructure
- [x] Handle cases where worker is not initialized
- [x] Add proper TypeScript types for completion results
- [x] Add error handling and fallback responses

### Agent Testing
- [ ] Test agent completion method with running worker
- [ ] Test error handling when worker is unavailable
- [ ] Verify completion results format

## Phase 4: Frontend Completion Source ✅

### CodeMirror Integration
- [x] Create `src/components/notebook/codemirror/pythonCompletion.ts`
- [x] Implement `createPythonCompletionSource()` function
- [x] Handle async completion requests
- [x] Map completion results to CodeMirror format
- [x] Add error handling and null checks

### Completion Source Testing
- [ ] Test completion source with mock runtime agent
- [ ] Verify CodeMirror completion result format
- [ ] Test error scenarios (agent unavailable, no completions)

## Phase 5: Editor Extensions ✅

### Base Extensions Update
- [x] Extend `baseExtensions.ts` with completion support
- [x] Create `createPythonExtensions()` function
- [x] Configure autocompletion options (blur, max options, etc.)
- [x] Ensure compatibility with existing extensions

### CodeMirror Editor Props
- [x] Add completion source prop to `CodeMirrorEditor`
- [x] Update editor extensions based on completion source
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility

## Phase 6: Cell Editor Integration ✅

### ExecutableCell Integration
- [x] Connect Python completion source to runtime agent
- [x] Use `useMemo` for performance optimization
- [x] Only enable completion for Python cells
- [x] Handle runtime agent availability

### Editor Component Updates
- [x] Pass completion source to CodeMirrorEditor
- [x] Update editor props and extensions
- [x] Test integration with existing cell functionality

## Testing & Verification

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test Python `get_completions()` function with various inputs
- [ ] Test worker message protocol for completions
- [ ] Test agent `getCompletions()` method
- [ ] Test CodeMirror completion source
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests  
- [ ] Test full completion flow (editor → agent → worker → Python)
- [ ] Test completion during different runtime states
- [ ] Test multi-user scenarios (completion doesn't interfere)
- [ ] Test performance with large code samples

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Basic Python completions (`print`, `len`, etc.)
- [ ] Module attribute completions (`numpy.array`, `pandas.DataFrame`)
- [ ] Variable completions (user-defined variables)
- [ ] Import completions (`from numpy import ...`)
- [ ] Method completions (`"string".upper()`)
- [ ] Completion behavior during code execution
- [ ] Error scenarios (runtime crashed, network issues)
- [ ] Performance testing (typing responsiveness)

## Performance & UX

### Optimization
- [ ] Implement request debouncing (avoid excessive requests)
- [ ] Add completion request timeout
- [ ] Cache recent completion results
- [ ] Limit concurrent completion requests

### User Experience
- [ ] Add loading indicators for completion requests
- [ ] Ensure completion only works with active Python runtime
- [ ] Test completion behavior across runtime lifecycle
- [ ] Verify no interference with collaborative editing

## Documentation & Polish

### Code Documentation
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to completion functions
- [ ] Document completion message protocol
- [ ] Add inline comments for complex logic
- [ ] Update type definitions

### User Documentation
- [ ] Update relevant documentation with completion feature
- [ ] Add completion to feature list
- [ ] Document any keyboard shortcuts or usage patterns

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Enhanced completion types (function, variable, module, etc.)
- [ ] Completion ranking and filtering
- [ ] Signature help integration
- [ ] Documentation on hover
- [ ] Cross-cell variable awareness

### Performance Improvements
- [ ] Background completion pre-loading
- [ ] Incremental parsing optimization
- [ ] Server-side completion caching

## Success Criteria Verification

### Primary Success Criteria
- [ ] Python cells show relevant completions for built-in functions
- [ ] Imported module attributes are completed correctly  
- [ ] User-defined variables appear in completions
- [ ] Completion works without interfering with multi-user editing
- [ ] Performance remains smooth during typing

### Secondary Success Criteria
- [ ] Completion works across different Python constructs
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback
- [ ] Completion gracefully handles runtime restart scenarios

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks acceptable
- [ ] Error handling tested
- [ ] Multi-user scenarios verified
- [ ] Code review completed

### Post-deployment
- [ ] Monitor completion request performance
- [ ] Track completion usage metrics
- [ ] Monitor for completion-related errors
- [ ] Gather user feedback

## Notes

- Use existing `sendWorkerMessage()` pattern for consistency
- Leverage IPython's built-in completer (no new dependencies)
- Keep completion requests separate from LiveStore events
- Focus on core functionality first, enhancements later
- Test thoroughly with various Python code patterns
- Ensure graceful degradation when runtime unavailable
