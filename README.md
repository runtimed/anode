# Anode

**The notebook that thinks with you.**

Anode is an **agentic notebook** where AI, code, and prose work together in
real-time. Never lose your outputs when tabs close. Collaborate with AI that
sees your data, not just your code. Pair with compute and intelligence.

**Note**: Public access coming soon - building BYOC and permissions first

## The Jupyter Problem We're Solving

As a long-time Jupyter contributor, I've always wanted to solve a core
architectural limitation: computation and documentation are artificially
coupled.

At Netflix, I watched people hold their laptops open walking to the parking lot,
hoping their Spark jobs would finish before they lost their browser session.
Your analysis is running on powerful clusters, but the results only "exist" in
your specific browser tab.

**The core problem**: You can't open the same notebook in multiple tabs.
Multiple people can't collaborate on the same server without conflicts. Your
work is trapped in a single browser session.

**Why this happens**: Jupyter's architecture wasn't designed for concurrent
access. The notebook exists as a file on disk, but the live state (outputs,
execution results) only lives in your browser. Close that tab, and you lose the
connection to work happening elsewhere.

**The bigger picture**: Your Spark job runs on a cluster. Your model trains on
GPUs. But somehow, the results are locked to the browser tab where you started
them. Modern computational work deserves better.

Jupyter's developers built something incredible that changed how we compute.
Collaboration has been challenging to implement well, and we think our
event-sourced approach offers a path forward that could benefit the broader
ecosystem.

**Anode's approach**: Persistent outputs that survive browser crashes, tab
closures, and device switches. Real-time collaboration without conflicts. AI
that sees your actual results. Full Jupyter compatibility through .ipynb
import/export. Your computation lives independently of any browser session.

## Agentic Notebook Vision

- **AI as development partner** - AI sees your outputs, creates cells, suggests
  next steps
- **Persistent computation** - Your work survives runtime crashes, tab closes,
  browser restarts, vpn disconnects, cafe WiFi
- **Seamless collaboration** - Your friends, local models, and foundational
  models working on the same notebook
- **Context-aware intelligence** - AI understands your data, not just your code
- **Zero-friction execution** - Code runs instantly, results appear everywhere

## Quick Start

**Requirements**: Node.js >=23.0.0 (use `nvm use` to automatically switch to the
correct version)

### 1. Install and Configure

```bash
pnpm install  # Install dependencies

# Copy environment configuration files
cp .env.example .env
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars

# Start development servers in separate terminals
pnpm dev           # Frontend at http://localhost:5173
pnpm dev:sync      # Backend at http://localhost:8787
pnpm dev:iframe    # Iframe outputs at http://localhost:8000
```

The example files contain sensible defaults that work for local development out of the box:

- `.env.example` ‚Üí `.env` - Frontend environment variables (Vite)
- `.dev.vars.example` ‚Üí `.dev.vars` - Backend environment variables (Worker)

### 2. Create Your First Notebook

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Click "New Notebook"
3. Start creating cells and editing

### 3. Get Runtime Command from UI

- Open the notebook interface
- Create a `RUNT_API_KEY` via your user profile
- Click the **Runtime** button in the notebook header
- Copy the exact `NOTEBOOK_ID=xxx pnpm dev:runtime` command shown
- Run that command in your terminal

### 4. Execute Code

- Add a code cell in the web interface
- Write Python: `import numpy as np; np.random.random(5)`
- Press **Ctrl+Enter** or click **Run**
- See results appear instantly

The Python runtime uses [@runt packages](https://github.com/runtimed/runt) for Python execution and AI features, providing a robust execution environment with rich output support.

## Production Deployment

Anode is deployed and accessible at **https://app.runt.run** using a unified Cloudflare Worker architecture that serves both the web client and backend API from a single worker.

### Architecture

- **All-in-one Worker**: Single worker serving both frontend assets and backend API
- **D1 Database**: Persistent storage for LiveStore events
- **R2 Bucket**: Artifact storage for large outputs (images, files, data)
- **Durable Objects**: WebSocket server for real-time sync

This unified architecture simplifies deployment while providing robust real-time collaboration and artifact storage capabilities.

## What You Can Do Today

### üåé Modeling your world

- No more copy pasting. Models can see code and outputs
- Ask questions about your plots, tables, and results
- AI creates new cells based on your notebook context
- Control what context AI sees with visibility toggles

### üîÑ Persistent Computation

- Outputs survive runtime restarts and browser crashes
- Work offline, sync when connected
- Rich outputs: plots, tables, colorized terminal output
- Package caching for fast startup (numpy, pandas, matplotlib)

### üë• Real-Time Collaboration

- Multiple people editing simultaneously
- Mobile-responsive design for editing on any device
- OIDC OAuth for secure access (when deployed)
- Share notebooks by copying the URL

## Coming Soon

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for detailed implementation plan.

**Frictionless Setup** - One-click runtime startup instead of copy/paste
commands.

**Multi-language Support** - The runtime architecture already supports other
languages with custom runtime agents. We just need UI updates!

## Local Development

### Schema Linking for Development

The `@runt/schema` package provides shared types and events between Anode and Runt. Use the appropriate linking method based on your development phase:

**Production (JSR Package)**:

```bash
pnpm use-runt prod
```

Should update package.json to:

```json
"@runt/schema": "jsr:^0.9.0"
```

**Testing PR Changes (GitHub Reference)**:

```bash
pnpm use-runt main
```

Should update package.json to use the hash of whatever is on `main` in the `runt` package:

```json
"@runt/schema": "github:runtimed/runt#1d52f9e51b9f28e81e366a7053d1e5fa6164c390&path:/packages/schema"
```

**Local Development (File Link)**:

```bash
pnpm use-runt local
```

Should update packages.json to use the local version of `runt`:

```json
"@runt/schema": "file:../runt/packages/schema"
```

**To switch between modes:**

1. Update `package.json` with the appropriate schema reference
2. Run `pnpm install` to update dependencies
3. Restart UI development server (`pnpm dev`)

**Important**: Ensure both repositories use compatible schema versions. Type errors usually indicate schema mismatches.

**Git Hook Protection**: A Husky pre-commit hook prevents accidentally committing `package.json` with `@runt/schema` using the `file:` protocol. This ensures the repository remains deployable. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#git-hook-protection) for details.

## üöÄ Groq AI Integration

Anode supports **Groq** as a first-class AI provider alongside OpenAI and Ollama, offering high-speed inference with advanced models.

### Available Groq Models

   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Start Iframe server**:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev:iframe
   ```

6. **Start Runtime**: Get the runtime command from the notebook UI, then:

   ```bash
   NOTEBOOK_ID=notebook-groq-$(date +%s) pnpm dev:runtime
   ```

7. **Access**: Visit `http://localhost:5173` and create/open a notebook

### Features

- ‚úÖ **All 5 Groq models** available in AI cell dropdown
- ‚úÖ **High-speed inference** - Typical response times 1-3 seconds
- ‚úÖ **Tool calling support** - AI can create and modify code cells
- ‚úÖ **Model persistence** - Notebooks remember your last selected model
- ‚úÖ **Orange provider badges** - Clear visual distinction in UI

### Critical Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Process Management**: Always run `pkill -f "pyodide-runtime-agent"` before starting new runtimes to prevent session conflicts.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Use nohup**: For persistent runtime processes that survive across terminal commands, use `nohup` instead of screen sessions.

### Configuration

Python runtime and AI features are handled by the separate [@runt packages](https://github.com/runtimed/runt). The integrated development server runs both frontend and backend in a single process for convenience.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                   | Solution                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Schema version mismatches | Ensure all services (web, runtime, sync) are restarted after schema changes |
| Type errors               | TypeScript catches invalid queries at compile time - check column names     |
| Execution not working     | Check @runt runtime setup - see https://github.com/runtimed/runt            |
| Dev server crashes        | Restart with `pnpm dev` - .env file changes are ignored to prevent crashes  |
| Build errors              | Run `pnpm type-check` to check for TypeScript issues                        |
| Wrangler issues in logs   | Run `rm -rf .wrangler`. üö® IMPORTANT: you will also lose your notebooks     |

## Why Anode Works

**Never lose your work**: Event-sourced architecture means every change is
preserved. Your outputs survive crashes, restarts, and network issues.

**AI sees your data**: Unlike other tools, AI has access to your actual
outputs‚Äîplots, tables, error messages‚Äînot just source code. We have a full
interactive runtime, so let it enjoy interactive computing too!

**Real-time everywhere**: Changes appear instantly across all connected devices.
Collaboration without having to email Untitled234.ipynb again.

**Local-first**: Works offline, syncs when connected. Your notebook is always
responsive, never waiting for the cloud.
