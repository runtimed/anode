* Who am I
  - Jupyter developer
  - Founder of nteract
* Netflix Parking lot
* "What if we could run an agent on a machine that connects the runtime back to a document engine?"
* A way forward: event sourcing
  - Note how we did similar in nteract with Redux, at Noteable with a JSON format, in CoCalc
* Explain event sourcing, livestore, etc.

## Parking Lot

Tempting to point out some non-event sourcing "I just have to solve it for this prototype" bits too:

* IFramed outputs (separate domain)
* Separate artifacts for outputs (to trim event log and store images as bytes)
