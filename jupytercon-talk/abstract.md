It's time to rip the band aid off. We're moving the notebook to the serverside. For the longest time, we've been trying to keep the notebook away from the kernel. That was a smart technical choice at the time. Now, we've learned enough to try some big bold new things with some new yet familiar concepts: runtime agents and event sourcing.

At Netflix, I watched colleagues hold their laptops open while walking to their car, hoping their Spark jobs would finish before they lost their browser session or their kids were done with soccer practice. Your analysis runs on powerful clusters, but somehow the results are locked to the browser tab where you started them. This is nuts.

We'll explore how moving document state to the server unlocks new modes of interaction. From familiar long running compute jobs to real-time collaboration with colleagues, all the way to autonomous AI editing.

Through live demos, we'll show notebooks that survive crashes, enable real-time collaboration, and let AI work autonomously on your data while maintaining full auditability. It's time to evolve our architecture to support the persistent, collaborative computing that modern data science demands.
